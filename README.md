Internal Audit for Botium Toys

# Introduction:
As part of my cybersecurity portfolio and the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera's "Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks" course, I conducted an internal security audit assessment for Botium Toys, a fictitious toy company.

The purpose of this audit is to evaluate Botium Toys’ security program, ensuring that current business practices are aligned with industry standards and best practices. The audit aims to identify vulnerabilities and provide mitigation recommendations. Additionally, the audit develops a comprehensive strategy to enhance the organization's overall security posture.

# Scenario:

**Scope:**
The scope of this audit is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes their assets like employee equipment and devices, their internal network, and their systems. You will need to review the assets Botium Toys has and the controls and compliance practices they have in place.

**Goal:**
Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices that need to be implemented to  improve Botium Toys’ security posture.
